## About Me

![Me with corgi](photos/me_with_corgi.png)


I'm a *Cognitive Science Major specializing in Machine Learning* and minor in *Computer Science*. I'm from **Los Angeles, California.** I like trying different food places so I have a couple google map collections of different food. I also like going to places/events with animals. If I had to rank my favorites based on what I've gone to recently:
  1. Corgi Beach Day
  2. Meerkat Cafe
  3. Bunny Cafe
  4. Cat Cafe
   
My favorite one was the Corgi Beach Day because they're my favorite dog and the owners let me hold them. One of the ladies there asked me,

> Where's your dog ?


and I had to tell her I did not have a dog but it was okay because the other people around me also did not have a dog.

## Programming
I started programming in highschool with Java and then have taken C and C++ through classes here. I self-taught myself Python and then programmed in it for my data science classes. I also tried to learn a bit of CSS and HTML on the side but didn't get too far with it. I'm  learning how to code in Swift but I don't think it'll be that relevant for this class. 

### Coding blocks
Just for markdown purposes I'll put Java, Python, and C codeblocks here"
- `System.out.println("Java");`
- `print('Python')`
- `printf(C);`

## Markdown Requirements

Too make sure I did all the requirements, I made a list in a different file: [Requirements](markdownReqs.md)
